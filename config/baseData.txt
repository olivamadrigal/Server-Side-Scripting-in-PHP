Prime:
Chebychev said it and I\'ll say it again\n
There\'s always a prime between n and 2n factorial\!\n:anonymous:5#
Erdo:
A conjecture both deep and profound\n 
Is whether the circle is round\n 
In a paper by Erdo\'s\,\n 
written in Kurdish\,\n 
A counterexample is found\.\n:anonynous:5 #
Integral:
Integral z\-squared dz\n 
from 1 to the cube root of 3\n 
times the cosine\n 
of three pi over 9\n 
equals log of the cube root of \'e\'.\n:anonymous:5# 

Euler:
If \(1+x\) \(real close to 1\) \n
Is raised to the power of 1 \n
Over x, you will find \n
Here's the value defined\:\n 
2.718281...\n:anynymous:5 #
pi:
\'Tis a favorite project of mine\n 
A new value of pi to assign.\n
I would fix it at 3\n 
For it\'s simpler\, you see\, 
Than 3 point 1 4 1 5 9 \n:anynymous:5 #
circle:
If inside a circle a line\n 
Hits the center and goes spine to spine\n 
And the line\'s length is \"d\" \n
the circumference will be \n
d times 3.14159\n:anynymous:5  #
